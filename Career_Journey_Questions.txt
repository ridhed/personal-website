1. What inspired you to choose your career path?
   Initially, I was drawn to commerce because of my love for math. By 10th grade, I knew I wanted a unique path—not mainstream options like engineering or medicine. Initially, I aspired to become a aeronautical engineer but I wasn't a fan of physics so just engineer was there to do when we removed physics from aeronautical.While exploring opportunities, my father introduced me to polytechnic studies, which fit both financially and academically as a twin sibling. My scores led me to a government engineering college in Nagpur, and though I didn't choose this path initially, it has since become my passion. After a gap year in 2024 to reassess my goals, I rediscovered my curiosity and passion, particularly inspired by the transformative potential of AI.I scored good marks that got me a Computer science and engineering seat in government college of engineering Nagpur. This is my path till now: I never choose this path It choose me. Sometimes when it is given to you without your asking you tend to forget it's worth. Now at this stage I thought this is not for me since i never choose it - I got lost. I wanted to my Ms in Canada and with offer letter in hand due to certain circumstances created in Canada and India relationship I cancelled my admission.
