<div class="tab active" onclick="showTab('career')">Career Journey</div>

1. What inspired you to choose your career path?
   Initially, I was drawn to commerce because of my love for math. By 10th grade, I knew I wanted a unique path—not mainstream options like engineering or medicine. Initially, I aspired to become an aeronautical engineer, but I wasn't a fan of physics. So, engineering became my choice when aeronautics was ruled out. While exploring opportunities, my father introduced me to polytechnic studies, which fit both financially and academically as a twin sibling. My scores led me to a government engineering college in Nagpur, and though I didn't choose this path initially, it has since become my passion. After a gap year in 2024 to reassess my goals, I rediscovered my curiosity and passion, particularly inspired by the transformative potential of AI. I scored well, which got me a Computer Science and Engineering seat in the Government College of Engineering Nagpur. This journey has shown me that sometimes paths choose you. At first, I undervalued it because it wasn’t my choice, but now I see its worth. The cancellation of my MS admission in Canada due to geopolitical circumstances and my subsequent gap year to reanalyze my aspirations have reignited my drive to make a social impact in India. In 2025, I rediscovered my curiosity and passion, especially for AI and its transformative potential.

2. What were your first steps into the industry?
   While I haven’t formally started working in the industry yet, I’ve been building my technical foundation through my education and certifications. I planned to pursue an MS in Canada but had to cancel due to geopolitical circumstances. Taking a gap year helped me refocus on my aspirations and align them with creating a social impact in India with the help of technology.

3. What challenges did you face early in your career?

   - Educational Confusion: Choosing a field without deep awareness of alternatives was challenging initially.
   - Pandemic Impact: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted my diploma studies and created uncertainties.
   - Missed Opportunities: The cancellation of my MS plans in Canada was a significant setback, forcing me to reorient my goals.
   - Self-Doubt: Questioning my place in the industry made me feel lost, but ultimately, these challenges reignited my drive.

4. What does a typical day in your job look like?
   Since I haven’t started working professionally yet, my current focus is on upskilling, building projects, and networking within the tech industry. My day involves studying new technologies, experimenting with AI, and exploring ways to make an impact.

5. How has your career evolved over the years?
   Starting with a lack of direction, I’ve gradually gained clarity and focus. My experiences have shaped me into someone ready to create meaningful change.
